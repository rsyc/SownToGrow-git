#---SCHOOL SUBJECT MAPPER---

The code in this repository is in Python.

## Project description
An online educational platform has data sets of school subject names, activities and classroom names. 
Activities, subjects and classes have been set up by multiple teachers from multiple schools leading to non-standardized list of classrooms. 
The company wants to map these activities, subjects and classes to standardized list or groups of subjects. 

## The data

Data was provided as csv files by the company. 

## Solution
Data cleaning (removing stop words, punctuations, numbers, one charecters), 
Making bag of sords for multi-word subjects and find the most frequent words,
Assigning new-word (most frequent) to multi-word subjects,
Make a standadized list of subjects (one-word) and their frequency of occurance in the data set,
Use the list to predict the subject/topic for each user entery. 


## End product and MVP

Ideal end product will allow to relate user input (including activity, class or subject name) to the list of main topics found by the model.
